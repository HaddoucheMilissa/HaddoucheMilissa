***Hi there, welcome to my profile!***
👋 Hello! I am currently a second-year computer science student at Numidia Institute of Technology (NIT). Passionate about the vast world of computer science, I easily adapt to new technologies.

🚀 My love for programming is particularly evident through my passionate interest in artificial intelligence, especially Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Simultaneously, I nurture a growing ambition to specialize in the crucial field of cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, I have undertaken comprehensive training tailored to acquire essential knowledge. These enriching experiences have strengthened my belief that programming is more than just a skill for me.

🌐 My versatility is expressed not only in code but also in languages. I am fluent in three languages: Arabic, English, and French. Currently, I am learning Spanish to broaden my linguistic horizons.
